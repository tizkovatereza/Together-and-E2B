### Why give your AI app code interpreting capabilities?

E2B is the code execution layer for the AI app. The benefits of an AI assistant being able to execute the code, as opposed to only generating it, are:

- Better reasoning
- More complex tasks (e.g., advanced data analysis or mathematics)
- Producing tangible results such as charts
- Immediate testing (and correcting) of the produced output.

### E2B as a secure code execution environment

The open-source [Code Interpreter SDK](https://github.com/e2b-dev/code-interpreter) by [E2B](https://e2b.dev/docs) provides a secure sandboxed environment where you can run the output generated by Together AI's LLMs. 


### Starting with Code Interpreter SDK

To start building with E2B and Together AI, check out the examples in the [Together doxcs](https://docs.together.ai/docs). You can choose from a [Python](LINK_HERE) or [JavaScript/TypeScript](LINK_HERE) version.

The Code Interpreter SDK is E2B's special SDK tailor-made for AI data analysts, coding apps, and reasoning-heavy agents. The SDK quickly creates a secure cloud sandbox inside which is running a Jupyter server that the LLM can use.

1, Get your E2B API key [here](https://e2b.dev/docs/getting-started/api-key) for free.

2. Install the SDK

JavaScript & TypeScript version:

```sh
npm i @e2b/code-interpreter
```

Python version:

```sh
pip install e2b_code_interpreter
```


3. Execute code with code interpreter inside sandbox

```js
import { CodeInterpreter } from '@e2b/code-interpreter'

const sandbox = await CodeInterpreter.create()
await sandbox.notebook.execCell('x = 1')

const execution = await sandbox.notebook.execCell('x+=1; x')
console.log(execution.text)  // outputs 2

await sandbox.close()
```

```python
from e2b_code_interpreter import CodeInterpreter

with CodeInterpreter() as sandbox:
    sandbox.notebook.exec_cell("x = 1")

    execution = sandbox.notebook.exec_cell("x+=1; x")
    print(execution.text)  # outputs 2
```


### More about E2B

E2B makes running AI-generated code in secure and isolated sandbox environments easy with the [Code Interpreter SDK](https://github.com/e2b-dev/code-interpreter). The SDK has a Python and JavaScript/TypeScript version.
E2B works with any LLM and any AI frameworks (e.g., [LangChain](https://github.com/e2b-dev/e2b-cookbook/tree/main/examples/langchain-python), LammaIndex, [Vercel AI SDK](https://github.com/e2b-dev/e2b-cookbook/tree/main/examples/nextjs-code-interpreter), CrewAI, [Autogen](https://github.com/e2b-dev/e2b-cookbook/tree/main/examples/e2b_autogen)).
Check out the [E2B docs](https://e2b.dev/docs) and [E2B Cookbook](https://github.com/e2b-dev/e2b-cookbook/tree/main).
