# E2B code interpreting
Learn how to use E2B in 100 lines of code!

## What is E2B?

E2B is the secure code execution layer for the AI app. The ability to execute the code as opposed to only generate it has many advantages:

- Better reasoning
- More complex tasks (e.g., advanced data analysis or mathematics)
- Producing tangible results such as charts
- Immediate testing (and correcting) of the produced output.


The open-source [Code Interpreter SDK](https://github.com/e2b-dev/code-interpreter) by [E2B](https://e2b.dev/docs) provides a long-running secure sandboxed environment where you can run the output generated by Together AI's LLMs. This SDK is tailor-made for AI data analysts, coding apps, and reasoning-heavy agents. The SDK quickly creates a secure cloud sandbox. Inside the sandbox is a running Jupyter server which the LLM can use.


## Trying E2B in 100 lines of code

### 1. Prerequisites

You can choose a JavaScript & TypesScript or Python version of this example. In the former case, create an `index.ts` file for the main program, `.gitignore` file containing
```sh
.env
.node_modules
```

and `.env` file that looks like this:

```
# TODO: Get your Together AI API key from https://api.together.xyz/settings/api-keys
TOGETHER_API_KEY = ""

# TODO: Get your E2B API key from https://e2b.dev/docs
E2B_API_KEY = ""
```

In the latter case, create just `main.ipynb` file.

Get the E2B API key [here](https://e2b.dev/docs/getting-started/api-key) and the Together AI API key [here](https://api.together.xyz/settings/api-keys).

Download the CSV file from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nishanthsalian/socioeconomic-country-profiles/code) and upload it to the same directory as your program. Rename it to `data.csv`.


### 2. Install the SDKs

JavaScript & TypeScript version:

```sh
npm i @e2b/code-interpreter
```

Python version:

```sh
pip install together==1.2.1 e2b-code-interpreter==0.0.10

```

### 3. Set up the API keys and model instructions.
In this step you upload your E2B and Together API keys to the program. In the JS & TS case, the API keys are stored in the `.env` file, in the Python case, they are added directly to the notebook.
You pick the Together AI model of your choice by uncommenting it. There are some recommended models great at code generation, but you can add a different one from [here](https://api.together.ai/models).

The model is assigned a data scientist role and explained the uploaded CSV. You can choose different data but need to update the instructions accordingly.
   
JavaScript & TypeScript version:


```js

```

Python version:

```python
# TODO: Get your Together AI API key from https://api.together.xyz/settings/api-keys
TOGETHER_API_KEY = ""

# TODO: Get your E2B API key from https://e2b.dev/docs
E2B_API_KEY = ""

# Choose from the codegen models:

# MODEL_NAME = "codellama/CodeLlama-70b-Instruct-hf"
# MODEL_NAME = "deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder-33b-instruct"
MODEL_NAME = "Qwen/Qwen2-72B-Instruct"
# See the complete list of Together AI models here: https://api.together.ai/models.

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You're a Python data scientist. You are given tasks to complete and you run Python code to solve them.

Generally, you follow these rules:
- ALWAYS FORMAT YOUR RESPONSE IN MARKDOWN
- ALWAYS RESPOND ONLY WITH CODE IN CODE BLOCK LIKE THIS:
    ```python
    {code}
    ```
- the Python code runs in jupyter notebook.
- every time you generate Python, the code is executed in a separate cell. it's okay to make multiple calls to `execute_python`.
- display visualizations using matplotlib or any other visualization library directly in the notebook. don't worry about saving the visualizations to a file.
- you have access to the internet and can make api requests.
- you also have access to the filesystem and can read/write files.
- you can install any pip package (if it exists) if you need to be running `!pip install {package}`. The usual packages for data analysis are already preinstalled though.
- you can run any Python code you want, everything is running in a secure sandbox environment
"""
```


### 4. Add code interpreting capabilities

Now we define the function that will use the code interpreter by E2B. Everytime the LLM assistant decides that it needs to execute code, this function will be used. Read more about the Code Interpreter SDK [here](https://e2b.dev/docs/code-interpreter/installation).

Python version:

```python
def code_interpret(e2b_code_interpreter, code):
  print("Running code interpreter...")
  exec = e2b_code_interpreter.notebook.exec_cell(
    code,
    on_stderr=lambda stderr: print("[Code Interpreter]", stderr),
    on_stdout=lambda stdout: print("[Code Interpreter]", stdout),
    # You can also stream code execution results
    # on_result=...
  )

  if exec.error:
    print("[Code Interpreter ERROR]", exec.error)
  else:
    return exec.results
```


### 5. Initialize the model

Now we initialize the Together AI client. The function `match_code_blocks` is important because we need to pick the right part of the output that contains the code produced by the LLM. The `chat_with_llm` function takes care of the interaction with the LLM. It calls the E2B code interpreter anytime there is a code to be run.


Python version:

```python
import os
import json
import re
from together import Together

client = Together(api_key=TOGETHER_API_KEY)

import re
pattern = re.compile(r'```python\n(.*?)\n```', re.DOTALL) # Match everything in between ```python and ```
def match_code_blocks(llm_response):
  match = pattern.search(llm_response)
  if match:
    code = match.group(1)
    print(code)
    return code
  return ""

def chat_with_llm(e2b_code_interpreter, user_message):
  print(f"\n{'='*50}\nUser message: {user_message}\n{'='*50}")

  messages = [
      {"role": "system", "content": SYSTEM_PROMPT},
      {"role": "user", "content": user_message}
  ]

  response = client.chat.completions.create(
      model=MODEL_NAME,
      messages=messages,
  )

  response_message = response.choices[0].message
  python_code = match_code_blocks(response_message.content)
  if python_code != "":
    code_interpreter_results = code_interpret(e2b_code_interpreter, python_code)
    return code_interpreter_results
  else:
    print(f"Failed to match any Python code in model's response {response_message}")
    return[]


```

### 6. Upload the dataset

The CSV data is uploaded programmatically, not via AI-generated code. The code interpreter by E2B runs inside the E2B sandbox. Read more about the file upload [here](https://e2b.dev/docs/sandbox/api/upload).


Python version:

```python
def upload_dataset(code_interpreter):
  print("Uploading dataset to Code Interpreter sandbox...")
  with open("./data.csv", "rb") as f:
    remote_path = code_interpreter.upload_file(f)
  print("Uploaded at", remote_path)
```

### 7. Put everything together

Finally we put everything together and let the AI assistant upload the data, run an analysis, and generate a PNG file with a chart. 
You can update the task for the assistant in this step. If you decide to change the CSV file you are using, don't forget to update the prompt too.

Python version:

```python
from e2b_code_interpreter import CodeInterpreter

with CodeInterpreter(api_key=E2B_API_KEY) as code_interpreter:
  # Upload the dataset to the code interpreter sandbox
  upload_dataset(code_interpreter)

  code_results = chat_with_llm(
    code_interpreter,
    "Make a chart showing linear regression of the relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy from the data. Filter out any missing values or values in wrong format."
  )
  if code_results:
    first_result = code_results[0]
  else:
    raise Exception("No code interpreter results")


# This will render the image
# You can also access the data directly
# first_result.png
# first_result.jpg
# first_result.pdf
# ...
first_result
```


### 8. Run the program and see the results

In the JS & TS version the resulting chart is saved to the same directory as a PNG file. In the Python version, the file is generated within the notebook. The plot shows the linear regression of the relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy from the CSV data.

Python version:

```python
Uploading dataset to Code Interpreter sandbox...
Uploaded at /home/user/data.csv

==================================================
User message: Make a chart showing linear regression of the relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy from the data. Filter out any missing values or values in wrong format.
==================================================
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the data
df = pd.read_csv('/home/user/data.csv', delimiter=',')

# Clean the data
df = df.dropna(subset=['GDP per capita (current US$)', 'Life expectancy at birth, total (years)'])
df['GDP per capita (current US$)'] = pd.to_numeric(df['GDP per capita (current US$)'], errors='coerce')
df['Life expectancy at birth, total (years)'] = pd.to_numeric(df['Life expectancy at birth, total (years)'], errors='coerce')

# Plot the data
sns.regplot(x='GDP per capita (current US$)', y='Life expectancy at birth, total (years)', data=df)
plt.title('Linear Regression of GDP per Capita vs Life Expectancy')
plt.xlabel('GDP per Capita (current US$)')
plt.ylabel('Life Expectancy (years)')
plt.show()
